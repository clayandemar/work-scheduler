# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## User Story

```md
AS a student
I WANT to have a planner/scheduler that shows me which things need to be done and at what time
SO THAT I can stay on top of my work
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a scheduler/planner for my 9-5 work
WHEN I open the website
THEN the time and date is displayed in the header
WHEN I look at the time blocks
THEN it shows what is the future, past, and present
WHEN I write data into the textbox of the hour
THEN it is saved to local storage and displayed back into the textbox.
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN no data is erased
```
